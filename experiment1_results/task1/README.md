- [Arabic Sub-corpus](https://github.com/dcavar/thec_ara)


The Task 1 data consists of a random mix of constructions with and without ellipsis. The task for an NLP pipeline or an LLM is to guess the position and full form of the elided words, phrases, and other content.



The data in these folders is related to the experiments described in Cavar et al. (2024) *Computing Ellipsis Constructions: Comparing Classical NLP and LLM Approaches*. If you use this data, please cite the following papers.
